## What is TSHA?

TSHA is a non-profit Tulsa Area United Way member agency. The focus at TSHA is to equip deaf, hard of hearing, and deaf with additional disabilities with the tools they need to live independently. TSHA also provides services for interested individuals: family, friends, employers, and employees. These services include sign language interpreters, advocacy, sign language classes, support groups, and information.

TSHA provides information and support to parents of children
with hearing loss. We support the philosophy that these
children can do anything they set their mind to do. 

TSHA has been providing qualified interpreters for Oklahoma
businesses, schools, doctor's and lawyer's offices, hospitals, courts
and many other locations too numerous to mention since the 1970's. 

TSHA can be visited [here](http://www.tsha.cc/).
